This small project is about creating monte carlo simulation to assess whether the risks taken on those crowdfunding plateform is enough or not. 
For the moment the code contains 3 classes to create Agents, Portfolio, Strategies and 1 to backtest it. 

Feel free to tinker with it, and suggest new ideas.
